# MyMopidy

Simple way to interact with mopidy (= control your music) via the terminal.
Very much in beta, lots of bugs and not even remotely optimized but feel
free to help me out with a general tip or a bug report.

No requirements file yet, but you need mopidy-soundcloud, spotify and gmusic
as well as websocket + websocket-client.

Mopidy obviously needs to be configured with your logins first.

USAGE:

Run mopidy in a separate terminal, then run main.py.
"man" gives you some basic commands and their usages
